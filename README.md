## Introduction

Flor strains of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* are specialized yeasts responsible for the biological aging of sherry-type wines, a process in which yeast cells form a floating biofilm called a velum (or flor) at the air–liquid interface of fortified wine (Alexandre, 2013). This velum is a major adaptive phenotype that allows flor yeasts to survive in the harsh winemaking environment, which is characterized by high ethanol concentrations (10–15% v/v), nutrient depletion, and low oxygen availability in the liquid phase (Legras et al., 2016). By forming a biofilm at the surface, yeast cells gain direct access to atmospheric oxygen, enabling a metabolic shift from fermentation to oxidative metabolism of ethanol and other non-fermentable carbon sources (Moreno-García et al., 2018). This metabolic transition drives the characteristic biochemical and sensory changes associated with biological wine aging, including the accumulation of acetaldehyde, acetals, and other volatile compounds that define the flavor profile of sherry wines (Mardanov et al., 2020).

Velum formation depends critically on the cell-surface adhesin encoded by *FLO11*, a member of the flocculin gene family in *S. cerevisiae* (Dranginis et al., 2007). Unlike other flocculins (Flo1p, Flo5p, Flo9p, Flo10p), which primarily mediate calcium-dependent cell–cell aggregation (flocculation), Flo11p is unique in enabling a broad range of adhesion-dependent phenotypes, including biofilm formation, velum formation, invasive growth, and pseudohyphal development (Zara et al., 2005; Purevdorj-Gage et al., 2007). The regulation of *FLO11* expression is exceptionally complex, involving one of the largest promoters in the yeast genome and integrating signals from the MAPK, cAMP-PKA, and TOR signaling pathways as well as epigenetic mechanisms involving noncoding RNAs (Brückner and Mösch, 2012; Váchová et al., 2021). Flor yeast strains often carry specific promoter deletions in the *ICR1* noncoding RNA region that constitutively enhance *FLO11* transcription, which is thought to be a key genetic adaptation underlying their capacity for velum formation (Fidalgo et al., 2006; Eldarov et al., 2018).

Mardanov et al. (2020) generated the first comprehensive RNA-seq transcriptome dataset for a flor yeast strain across multiple stages of velum development under experimental winemaking conditions. Using the industrial flor strain I-329, they collected samples at three developmental stages spanning 71 days: early biofilm (38 days post-inoculation), thin biofilm (83 days), and mature biofilm (109 days), with three biological replicates per stage. Their analysis revealed dynamic changes in gene expression involving carbon metabolism, cell wall biogenesis, stress response, and adhesion genes, but their differential expression analysis relied on the older DESeq methodology (Anders and Huber, 2010) with a reference-guided alignment approach. In this assignment, I reanalyze the Mardanov et al. (2020) RNA-seq dataset using a modern lightweight quantification pipeline based on Salmon and DESeq2, followed by functional enrichment analysis with clusterProfiler. This approach allows me to independently evaluate the transcriptomic changes occurring during velum maturation and to examine how specific genes and pathways contribute to the biological transition from early to mature biofilm.

I chose Salmon (Patro et al., 2017) for transcript quantification because it uses a quasi-mapping algorithm that avoids the computational cost of full read alignment while providing accurate abundance estimates with built-in correction for GC-content bias and sequence-specific bias. Compared to traditional alignment-based approaches such as HISAT2/featureCounts or STAR/HTSeq, Salmon is substantially faster and has been shown to yield more accurate transcript-level estimates, particularly for genes belonging to families with similar sequences (Patro et al., 2017). One limitation of alignment-free methods is that they do not produce a BAM file for visual inspection of read pileups, which means some types of quality assessment (such as checking for unexpected splice patterns or contamination at specific loci) are not possible without a separate alignment step. However, for standard differential expression workflows, the speed and accuracy advantages of Salmon are well established (Soneson et al., 2015). I used DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) for differential expression because it implements a generalized linear model framework with shrinkage estimation of dispersions, which is designed for RNA-seq experiments with small sample sizes and provides robust statistical inference. Compared to edgeR, which uses a different approach to dispersion estimation and can be more liberal in calling DE genes, DESeq2 tends to be more conservative and produces well-calibrated false discovery rates (Love et al., 2014). I used clusterProfiler (Wu et al., 2021) for functional enrichment because it provides a unified framework for Gene Ontology and KEGG over-representation analysis as well as gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and it integrates well with organism-specific annotation databases for yeast.
